# Zombies and Health Counter
If you just want to use the mod, use the precompiled version. If you want to change anything about the mod, you can use the Source Code.
## INSTALLATION
###### PRECOMPILED
- Take the precompiled file and place it in _**%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm**_
###### EDITING SOURCE CODE
- Compile _**main.gsc**_ and place it in _**%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm**_

## CHANGES
- Replaced *setText* to *setValue* to prevent overflow crashes.
